            <p>
                Chemical substance that occurs in many plants and animals and which is both a derivative and a structural analog of tryptamine.
                It can be consumed as a psychedelic drug and has historically been prepared by various cultures for ritual purposes as an entheogen.

            <h3>Psilocybin mushroom</h3>
            <p>
                Common, colloquial terms for psilocybin mushrooms include psychedelic mushrooms, booms, magic mushrooms, shrooms, and mush.
                Biological genera containing psilocybin mushrooms include Copelandia, Gymnopilus, Inocybe, Mycena, Panaeolus, Pholiotina, Pluteus, and Psilocybe.
